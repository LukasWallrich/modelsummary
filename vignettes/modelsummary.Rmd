`modelsummary` includes a powerful set of utilities to customize the information displayed in your model summary tables. You can easily rename, reorder, subset or omit parameter estimates; choose the set of goodness-of-fit statistics to display; display various "robust" standard errors or confidence intervals; add titles, footnotes, or source notes; insert stars or custom characters to indicate levels of statistical significance; or add rows with supplemental information about your models.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(modelsummary)
library(kableExtra)
library(gt)

url <- 'https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/HistData/Guerry.csv'
dat <- read.csv(url)

models <- list(
  "OLS 1"     = lm(Donations ~ Literacy + Clergy, data = dat),
  "Poisson 1" = glm(Donations ~ Literacy + Commerce, family = poisson, data = dat),
  "OLS 2"     = lm(Crime_pers ~ Literacy + Clergy, data = dat),
  "Poisson 2" = glm(Crime_pers ~ Literacy + Commerce, family = poisson, data = dat),
  "OLS 3"     = lm(Crime_prop ~ Literacy + Clergy, data = dat)
)

modelsummary(models)
```

# Uncertainty estimates

By default, `modelsummary` prints an uncertainty estimate in parentheses below the corresponding coefficient estimate. The value of this estimate is determined by the `statistic` argument.

`statistic` must be a string which equal to `conf.int`, one of the columns produced by the `broom::tidy` function, or a [glue string](https://glue.tidyverse.org/). 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
modelsummary(models, statistic = 'std.error')
modelsummary(models, statistic = 'p.value')
modelsummary(models, statistic = 'statistic')
```

You can display confidence intervals in brackets by setting `statistic="conf.int"`:

```{r}
modelsummary(models, gof_omit = ".*",
             statistic = 'conf.int', 
             conf_level = .99)
```

Alternatively, you can supply a [glue string](https://glue.tidyverse.org/) to get more complicated results:

```{r}
modelsummary(models, gof_omit = ".*",
             statistic = "{std.error} ({p.value})")
```

You can also display several different uncertainty estimates below the coefficient estimates. For example,

```{r}
modelsummary(models, gof_omit = ".*",
             statistic = c("conf.int",
                           "s.e. = {std.error}", 
                           "t = {statistic}",
                           "p = {p.value}"))
```

Setting `statistic=NULL` omits all statistics. This can often be useful if, for example, you want to display confience intervals next to coefficients: 

```{r}
modelsummary(models, gof_omit = ".*",
             estimate = "{estimate} [{conf.low}, {conf.high}]",
             statistic = NULL)
```

You can override the uncertainty estimates in a number of ways. First, you can specify a function that produces variance-covariance matrices:

```r
library(sandwich)
modelsummary(models, statistic_override = vcovHC, statistic = 'p.value')
```

You can supply a list of functions of the same length as your model list:

```r
modelsummary(models, 
   statistic_override = list(vcov, vcovHC, vcovHAC, vcovHC, vcov))
```

You can supply a list of named variance-covariance matrices:

```r
vcov_matrices <- lapply(models, vcovHC)
modelsummary(models, statistic_override = vcov_matrices)
```

You can supply a list of named vectors:

```r
custom_stats <- list(`OLS 1` = c(`(Intercept)` = 2, Literacy = 3, Clergy = 4), 
                     `Poisson 1` = c(`(Intercept)` = 3, Literacy = -5, Commerce = 3),
                     `OLS 2` = c(`(Intercept)` = 7, Literacy = -6, Clergy = 9), 
                     `Poisson 2` = c(`(Intercept)` = 4, Literacy = -7, Commerce = -9),
                     `OLS 3` = c(`(Intercept)` = 1, Literacy = -5, Clergy = -2))
modelsummary(models, statistic_override = custom_stats)
```

# Alignment

By default, `modelsummary` will align the first column (with coefficient names) to the left, and will center the results columns. To change this default, you can use the align argument, which accepts a string or vector of strings:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
modelsummary(models, align="lrrrrr")
modelsummary(models, align=c("l", "r", "r", "r", "r", "r"))
```

Many users want to align values on the decimal dot. Unfortunately, I am not aware of a single way to achieve this outcome for all output formats (pdf/latex, markdown, html). However, it is possible to do decimal alignment in LaTeX or Rmarkdown PDF documents, by using the `dcolumn` LaTeX package. Consider this Rmarkdown document:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/987057/95660928-14617d80-0af9-11eb-9e48-504231a0484f.png" width="70%">

Compiling the code above produces this table:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/987057/95660797-53430380-0af8-11eb-97d9-9ec2ad2608fb.png" width="40%">

# Titles

You can add a title to your table as follows:

```r
modelsummary(models, title = 'This is a title for my table.')
```

# Notes

Add notes to the bottom of your table:

```r
modelsummary(models, 
   notes = list('Text of the first note.', 
                'Text of the second note.'))
```

# Rename, reorder, and subset

`modelsummary` offers a powerful and innovative mechanism to rename, reorder, and subset coefficients and goodness-of-fit statistics.

## Coefficient estimates

You can rename coefficients using the `coef_rename` argument. For example, if you have two models with different explanatory variables, but you want both variables to have the same names and appear ont he same row, you can do:

```{r}
x <- list(
  lm(hp ~ drat, mtcars),
  lm(hp ~ vs, mtcars)
  )
modelsummary(x, coef_rename=c("drat"="Explanator", "vs"="Explanator"))
```

The `coef_map` argument is a named vector which allows users to rename, reorder, and subset coefficient estimates. Values of this vector correspond to the "clean" variable name. Names of this vector correspond to the "raw" variable name. The table will be sorted in the order in which terms are presented in `coef_map`. Coefficients which are *not* included in `coef_map` will be excluded from the table.

```{r}
cm <- c('Literacy' = 'Literacy (%)',
        'Commerce' = 'Patents per capita',
        '(Intercept)' = 'Constant')
modelsummary(models, coef_map = cm)
```

An alternative mechanism to subset coefficients is to use the `coef_omit` argument. This string is a regular expression which will be fed to `stringr::str_detect` to detect the variable names which should be excluded from the table.

```{r}
modelsummary(models, coef_omit = "Intercept|Commerce", gof_omit=".*")
```

Since `coef_omit` accepts regexes, you can do interesting things with it, such as specifying the list of variables that `modelsummary` should *keep* instead of omit. To do this, we use the `[^]` construct that specifies what *not* to match, we use the `|` pipe operator to separate the list of variables to include:

```{r}
modelsummary(models, coef_omit = "[^Commerce|(Intercept)]", gof_omit=".*")
```

## Goodness-of-fit and other statistics

`gof_omit` is a regular expression which will be fed to `stringr::str_detect` to detect the names of the statistics which should be excluded from the table.

```r
modelsummary(models, gof_omit = 'DF|Deviance|R2|AIC|BIC')
```

A more powerful mechanism is to supply a `data.frame` (or `tibble`) through the `gof_map` argument. This data.frame must include 4 columns:

1. `raw`: a string with the name of a column produced by `broom::glance(model)`.
2. `clean`: a string with the "clean" name of the statistic you want to appear in your final table.
3. `fmt`: a string which will be used to round/format the string in question (e.g., `"%.3f"`). This follows the same standards as the `fmt` argument in `?modelsummary`.
4. `omit`: `TRUE` if you want the statistic to be omitted from your final table.

You can see an example of a valid data frame by typing `modelsummary::gof_map`. This is the default data.frame that `modelsummary` uses to subset and reorder goodness-of-fit statistics. As you can see, `omit == TRUE` for quite a number of statistics. You can include setting `omit == FALSE`: 

```r
gm <- modelsummary::gof_map
gm$omit <- FALSE
modelsummary(models, gof_map = gm)
```

The goodness-of-fit statistics will be printed in the table in the same order as in the `gof_map` data.frame.

Notice the subtle difference between `coef_map` and `gof_map`. On the one hand, `coef_map` works as a "white list": any coefficient not explicitly entered will be omitted from the table. On the other, `gof_map` works as a "black list": statistics need to be explicitly marked for omission.

# Stars

Some people like to add "stars" to their model summary tables to mark statistical significance. The `stars` argument can take three types of input:

1. `NULL` omits any stars or special marks (default)
2. `TRUE` uses these default values: `* p < 0.1, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01`
3. Named numeric vector for custom stars.

```r
modelsummary(models)
modelsummary(models, stars = TRUE) 
modelsummary(models, stars = c('+' = .1, '&' = .01)) 
```

Whenever `stars != FALSE`, `modelsummary` adds a note at the bottom of the table automatically. If you would like to omit this note, just use the `stars_note` argument:

```r
modelsummary(models, stars = TRUE, stars_note = FALSE) 
```

If you want to create your own stars description, you can add custom notes with the [`notes`](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/modelsummary#notes) argument.

# Rounding

The `fmt` argument defines how numeric values are rounded and presented in the table. This argument follows the `sprintf` C-library standard. For example,

* `%.3f` will keep 3 digits after the decimal point, including trailing zeros.
* `%.5f` will keep 5 digits after the decimal point, including trailing zeros.
* Changing the `f` for an `e` will use the exponential decimal representation.

Most users will just modify the `3` in `%.3f`, but this is a very powerful system, and all users are encouraged to read the details: `?sprintf`

```r
modelsummary(models, fmt = '%.7f')
```

# `add_rows`

Use the `add_rows` argument to add rows manually to a table. For example, let's say you estimate two models with a factor variables and you want to insert (a) an empty line to identify the category of reference, and (b) cutomized information at the bottom of the table:

```{r}
models <- list()
models[['OLS']] <- lm(mpg ~ factor(cyl), mtcars)
models[['Logit']] <- glm(am ~ factor(cyl), mtcars, family = binomial)
```

We create a data.frame with the same number of columns as the summary table. Then, we define a "position" attribute to specify where the new rows should be inserted in the table. Finally, we pass this data.frame to the `add_rows` argument:

```{r}
library(tibble)
rows <- tribble(~term,          ~OLS,  ~Logit,
                'factor(cyl)4', '-',   '-',
                'Info',         '???', 'XYZ')
attr(rows, 'position') <- c(3, 9)

modelsummary(models, add_rows = rows)
```

# Extra tidy arguments (e.g., exponentiated coefficients)

Users can pass any additional argument they want to the `tidy` method which is used to extract estimates from a model. For example, in logitistic or Cox proportional hazard models, many users want to exponentiate coefficients to faciliate interpretation. The `tidy` functions supplied by the `broom` package allow users to set `exponentiate=TRUE` to achieve this. In `modelsummary`, users can use the same argument:

```r
mod_logit <- glm(am ~ mpg, data = mtcars, family = binomial)
modelsummary(mod_logit, exponentiate = TRUE)
```

Any argument supported by `tidy` is thus supported by `modelsummary`.

Warning: at the moment (2020-05-05), `broom::tidy` still reports `std.error` on the original scale. See this [discussion on the `broom` GitHub page.](https://github.com/tidymodels/broom/issues/422)

# Customizing the look of your table

To customize the appearance of tables, `modelsummary` supports four of the most popular table-making packages: 

1. [`gt`: https://gt.rstudio.com](https://gt.rstudio.com)
2. [`kableExtra`: http://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra](http://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra)
3. [`huxtable`: https://hughjonesd.github.io/huxtable/](https://hughjonesd.github.io/huxtable/)
4. [`flextable`: https://davidgohel.github.io/flextable/](https://davidgohel.github.io/flextable/)

Users are encouraged to visit these websites to determine which package suits their needs best. Each of them has different strengths and weaknesses. For instance, `gt` allows seamless integration with the RStudio IDE, but `kableExtra`'s LaTeX (and PDF) output is far more mature.

To create customized tables, the analyst begins by calling `modelsummary(models)` to create a summary table. Then, she *post-processes* the table by applying functions from one of the packages listed above. It is often convenient to use the `%>%` operator to do this.

To illustrate, we download data from the [Rdatasets repository](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets') and we estimate 5 models:

```{r}
library(modelsummary)

url <- 'https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/HistData/Guerry.csv'
dat <- read.csv(url)

models <- list()
models[['OLS 1']] <- lm(Donations ~ Literacy, data = dat)
models[['Poisson 1']] <- glm(Donations ~ Literacy + Clergy, family = poisson, data = dat)
models[['OLS 2']] <- lm(Crime_pers ~ Literacy, data = dat)
models[['Poisson 2']] <- glm(Crime_pers ~ Literacy + Clergy, family = poisson, data = dat)
models[['OLS 3']] <- lm(Crime_prop ~ Literacy + Clergy, data = dat)
```

In the rest of this vignette, we will customize tables using tools supplied by the `gt`, `kableExtra`, `flextable`, and `huxtable` packages. In each case, the pattern will be similar. First, we create a table by calling `modelsummary` and by specifying the output format with the `output` parameter. Then, we will use functions from the four packages to customize the appearance of our tables.

## `gt`

To illustrate how to customize tables using the `gt` package we will use the following functions from the `gt` package:

* `tab_spanner` creates labels to group columns.
* `tab_footnote` adds a footnote and a matching marking in a specific cell.
* `tab_style` can modify the text and color of rows, columns, or cells.

To produce a "cleaner" look, we will also use `modelsummary`'s `stars`, `coef_map`, `gof_omit`, and `title` arguments.

Note that in order to access `gt` functions, we must first load the library.

```{r}
library(gt)

# build table with `modelsummary` 
cm <- c( '(Intercept)' = 'Constant', 'Literacy' = 'Literacy (%)', 'Clergy' = 'Priests/capita')
cap <- 'A modelsummary table customized with gt'

tab <- modelsummary(models, 
                output = "gt",
                coef_map = cm, stars = TRUE, 
                title = cap, gof_omit = 'IC|Log|Adj') 

# customize table with `gt`

tab %>%

    # column labels
    tab_spanner(label = 'Donations', columns = 2:3) %>%
    tab_spanner(label = 'Crimes (persons)', columns = 4:5) %>%
    tab_spanner(label = 'Crimes (property)', columns = 6) %>%

    # footnote
    tab_footnote(footnote = md("A very **important** variable."),
                 locations = cells_body(rows = 3, columns = 1)) %>%

    # text and background color
    tab_style(style = cell_text(color = 'red'),
              locations = cells_body(rows = 3)) %>%
    tab_style(style = cell_fill(color = 'lightblue'),
              locations = cells_body(rows = 5))
```

The [`gt` website](https://gt.rstudio.com) offers many more examples. The possibilities are endless. For instance, `gt` allows you to embed images in your tables using the `text_transform` and `local_image` functions:

```{r}
f <- function(x) web_image(url = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/987057/82732352-b9aabf00-9cda-11ea-92a6-26750cf097d0.png", height = 80)

tab %>% 
    text_transform(locations = cells_body(columns = 2:6, rows = 1), fn = f)
```

## `kableExtra`

We will now illustrate how to customize tables using functions from the `kableExtra` package:

* `add_header_above` creates labels to group columns.
* `add_footnote` adds a footnote and a matching marking in a specific cell.
* `row_spec` can modify the text and color of rows, columns, or cells.

We use the same code as above, but specify `output='kableExtra'` in the `modelsummary()` call:

```{r}
library(kableExtra)

# build table with `modelsummary` 
cm <- c( '(Intercept)' = 'Constant', 'Literacy' = 'Literacy (%)', 'Clergy' = 'Priests/capita')
cap <- 'A modelsummary table customized with kableExtra'

tab <- modelsummary(models, output = 'kableExtra',
                coef_map = cm, stars = TRUE, 
                title = cap, gof_omit = 'IC|Log|Adj') 

# customize table with `kableExtra`
tab %>%
    
    # column labels
    add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Donations" = 2, "Crimes (person)" = 2, "Crimes (property)" = 1)) %>%
   
    # text and background color
    row_spec(3, color = 'red') %>%
    row_spec(5, background = 'lightblue')
```

These `kableExtra` functions can be used to produce LaTeX / PDF tables such as this one:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/987057/82732382-e068f580-9cda-11ea-8924-331550f8f1e8.png" width="40%">


## `flextable`

We will now illustrate how to customize tables using functions from the `flextable` package:


* `color` to modify the color of the text
* `bg` to modify the color of the background
* `autofit` sets column width to sensible values.

We use the same code as above, but specify `output='flextable'` in the `modelsummary()` call:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(flextable)

# build table with `modelsummary` 
cm <- c( '(Intercept)' = 'Constant', 'Literacy' = 'Literacy (%)', 'Clergy' = 'Priests/capita')
cap <- 'A modelsummary table customized with flextable'

tab <- modelsummary(models, output = 'flextable',
                coef_map = cm, stars = TRUE, 
                title = cap, gof_omit = 'IC|Log|Adj') 

# customize table with `flextable`
tab %>%
   
    # text and background color
    color(3, color = 'red') %>%
    bg(5, bg = 'lightblue') %>%
  
    # column widths
    autofit()
```


## `huxtable`

We will now illustrate how to customize tables using functions from the `huxtable` package:

* `set_text_color` to change the color of some entries

We use the same code as above, but specify `output='huxtable'` in the `modelsummary()` call:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(huxtable)

# build table with `modelsummary` 
cm <- c( '(Intercept)' = 'Constant', 'Literacy' = 'Literacy (%)', 'Clergy' = 'Priests/capita')
cap <- 'A modelsummary table customized with huxtable'

tab <- modelsummary(models, output = 'huxtable',
                coef_map = cm, stars = TRUE, 
                title = cap, gof_omit = 'IC|Log|Adj') 

# customize table with `huxtable`
tab %>%
   
    # text color
    set_text_color(row = 4, col = 1:ncol(.), value = 'red')
```

## Warning: Saving to file

When users supply a file name to the `output` argument, the table is written immediately to file. This means that users cannot post-process and customize the resulting table using functions from `gt`, `kableExtra`, `huxtable`, or `flextable`. When users specify a filename in the `output` argument, the `modelsummary()` call should be the *final* one in the chain.

This is OK:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
modelsummary(models, output = 'table.html')
```

This is **not** OK:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
modelsummary(models, output = 'table.html') %>%
    tab_spanner(label = 'Literacy', columns = c('OLS 1', 'Poisson 1'))
```

To save a customized table, you should apply all the customization functions you need before saving it using `gt::gtsave`, `kableExtra::save_kable`, or the appropriate helper function from the package that you are using to customize your table.
